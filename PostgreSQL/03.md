# Alteration

* By default, PostgreSQL acquires an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on the table when adding a column without a default value
* `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` does not rewrite the table or block other transactions for a significant amount of time
* The new column appears as `NULL` in all existing rows
* If a long-running transaction is already holding a lock on the table, the `ALTER TABLE` command will have to wait for that transaction to finish

```sql
ALTER TABLE fruits ADD COLUMN factory VARCHAR(255)
```
