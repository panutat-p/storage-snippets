# Alteration

## `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock

* `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock is the most restrictive lock type that block all read and write operations
* `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock is usually held for a very short time

## Alter table without initial values

* PostgreSQL acquires an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on the table when adding a column without a default value
* This command acquires an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on the table for a very short time because it just adds a column to the system catalogs
* This command does not rewrite the table
* The new column appears as `NULL` in all existing rows

```sql
ALTER TABLE fruits ADD COLUMN factory VARCHAR(255)
```
