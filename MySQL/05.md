# Pessimistic Locking

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT id, name, price FROM fruit WHERE name = 'apple' FOR UPDATE;
DO SLEEP(10);
COMMIT;
```

```sql
UPDATE fruit SET price = 100 WHERE name = 'banana';
```

## TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL

```sql
SELECT @@transaction_isolation;
```

### READ COMMITTED (default in many databases)

```sql
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
```

* Lock only the specific rows and avoid gap locking
* But also uses next-key locks which means it locks the index range scanned
* Does not prevent all forms of conflicts
* Does not prevent non-repeatable reads or phantom reads

> Non-repeatable reads occur when a transaction reads the same row twice and gets different results each time
> because another transaction has updated the row in the meantime.

### REPEATABLE READ (default in MySQL)

```sql
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
```

* In certain circumstances, the `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE statement` can lock more than just the rows it retrieves
* MySQL acquires exclusive next-key locks for the rows it retrieves
* The next-key lock is a combination of a record lock on the index record and a gap lock on the gap before the index record
* This means that not only the selected row is locked, but also the gap before this row in the index order

> In this case, if the 'apple' row comes before the 'banana' row in the index order,
> the `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` statement on 'apple' will also lock the gap before 'banana',
> preventing any new rows from being inserted in this gap or any modification to the 'banana' row until the lock is released.

### SERIALIZABLE

```sql
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

* The highest isolation level
* Guaranteed to be serial in that it appears to the user as though transactions were executed one after another
* Prevents both non-repeatable reads and phantom reads
