## `_id`

> Loading the fielddata on the _id field is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
> If you require sorting or aggregating on this field you should also include the id in the body of your documents,
> and map this field as a keyword field that has `doc_values` enabled

## `doc_values`

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/doc-values.html

> All fields which support doc values have them enabled by default.
> If you are sure that you don’t need to sort or aggregate on a field, or access the field value from a script,
> you can disable doc values in order to save disk space
